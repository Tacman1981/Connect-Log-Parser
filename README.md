# Connect Log Parser
 
For use with my public plugin ConnectLogger, which logs connect and disconnect events. This application will display the daily peak, currently without timestamps, but 1 bar for each day since the log file began (wiped on new save). The plugin and this application while being public, may not be copied without express permission.
